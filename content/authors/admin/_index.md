Hi, I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Urban and Environmental Planning and Policy program at the Department of Urban Planning and Public Policy in the School of Social Ecology at UC Irvine.

My research interests include examining transportation innovation impacts on suburban sustainability. Additionally, I am interested in artificial intelligence and synthetic data implications in planning. I am also interested in leveraging ML and data science methodologies to explore urban planning issues. 

My most recent publication assesses the equity impacts of market-rate residential parking permits. Before returning to academia, I held public and private sector positions working in rail planning, transit bus operations, train station management, and active transportation planning. 

I hold a Master of Urban and Regional Planning (Transportation and GIS focus) from Cal Poly Pomona and a BA in Geography with an Urban and Regional Studies minor from UCLA.
